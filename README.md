An android app that allows Storytellers and Players alike to store their World Of Darkness Character Sheets.

Storytellers can access the sheets of their Players, along with those of their NPCs, allowing smooth editing, rolling, and usage for your campaigns.

Currently there are plans to implement Hunter: The Reckoning, Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition, and Mage The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition character sheets.
